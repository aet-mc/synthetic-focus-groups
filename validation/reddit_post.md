Hi r/SampleSize!

I'm doing research on how people evaluate new product concepts. The survey shows you **3 different product ideas** and asks you to rate them on a few dimensions + share your thoughts.

**Takes about 10-12 minutes.** All responses are anonymous.

🔗 **Survey link:** [LINK_HERE]

**Who can take it:** Anyone 18+ (US preferred but all welcome)

**What you'll evaluate:**
- A wearable AI device concept
- A pet food subscription concept  
- A fitness rewards app concept

No trick questions, no sign-up required. Your honest reactions are what matter — there are no right or wrong answers.

Thanks for your time! Happy to answer any questions in the comments.

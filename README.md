# Synthetic Focus Groups

AI-powered market research platform that simulates realistic focus group discussions using grounded personas and multi-agent orchestration.

## What This Is

Traditional focus groups cost $15-65K, take 4-8 weeks, and use 8-12 people. We simulate them in minutes with AI personas grounded in real demographic and behavioral data, producing the same quality insights at 1/20th the cost.

**Core differentiator:** We're the only platform that simulates actual group dynamics — conformity pressure, opinion leadership, cascade effects — because we built it on a production multi-agent orchestration system.
